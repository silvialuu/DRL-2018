------------
This repository features work from 2018 summer research project on deep reinforcement learning (advised by Prof. Keith Ross, funded by NYU Shanghai Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund). In this project, we experimented with combining Policy Gradient methods -- vanilla Policy Gradient (aka REINFORCE), Actor-Critic, and PPO --  with Evolution Strategy to devise a hybrid algorithm with improved sample efficiency. Performances of the proposed algorithms were evaluated on MuJoCo benchmarks.\
